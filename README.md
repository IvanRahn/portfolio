###Brief History of Internet

The invention of the network and packet switching in mid 20th century and the formalization of TCP/IP protocol in 1982 were the foundation of the internet as we know it.
The global adoption of TCP/IP began with CERN in Europe in 1984.
The first Asian country to set up TCP/IP network was South Korea. And Australia adopted the protocols and formed a IP based network called AARNet in 1989.
